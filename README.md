# Wheel-of-Fortune-using-Python

I built this **Wheel of Fortune game** using OOPS Concepts learnt from [Course 4: Python Classes and Inheritance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-classes-inheritance?specialization=python-3-programming) of [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming)
